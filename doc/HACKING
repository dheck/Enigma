Hacking
=======

If you intend to modify the source code, you may additionally need
these programs:

    * GNU Autotools (autoconf >= 2.5, automake)
    * ImageMagick

You can pass the '--build-tools' flag to the configure script to build
a few additional programs that may be useful if you intend to seriously
play with Enigma's internals.

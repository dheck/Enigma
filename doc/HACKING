Hacking
=======

If you intend to modify the source code, you may additionally need
these programs:

    * GNU Autotools (autoconf >= 2.5, automake)
    * ImageMagick

You can pass the '--enable-tools' flag to the configure script to build
a few additional programs that may be useful if you intend to seriously
play with Enigma's internals.


FAQ - Notes

- unreadable characters in sources --- utf8 coded sources like menu.cc, *.po 

GCC incl 4.0 does not support standard C++ unicode escapes like "\u00E7" as a 
french cedille. But GCC accepts code written coded as utf8.
Please configure your editor to read and write utf8.

- enigma.pot as a generated file in repository
enigma.pot is made if missing and on explicit command (make dist ) but not
on standard make due to performance issues. If not in repository enigma.pot 
would be regenerated once after checkout with an update of all *.po. 
Further changes would be ignored and all resulting *.po would be recommited 
into the repository!

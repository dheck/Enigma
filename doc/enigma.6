.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The object of the game is to find and uncover pairs of identically
colored Oxyd stones. Simple? Yes. Easy? Certainly not!  Hidden
traps, vast mazes, laser beams, and, most of all, countless hairy
puzzles usually block your direct way to the Oxyd stones.  Enigma's
game objects (and there are hundreds of them, lest you get bored)
interact in many unexpected ways, and since many of them follow the laws of
physics (Enigma's special laws of physics, that is), controlling them
with the mouse isn't always trivial .\|.\|.\|

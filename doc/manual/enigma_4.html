<!--docid::SEC29::-->
<P>

This chapter contains hints for some of the difficult levels.  You are
strongly advised <EM>not</EM> to read the spoilers unless you are
completely stuck.  Some levels are intentionally difficult and even
veteran Enigma players need hours to solve them.  Some levels are
easier to solve in easy game mode (see section <A HREF="enigma_2.html#SEC9">2.1.2 Game Options</A>).

<H2> 4.1 Walkthrough for Tutorial </H2>
<!--docid::SEC30::-->
<P>

The landscapes in the &quot;Tutorial&quot; level pack are supposed to be easy.
Except for the last one, which is not...  This section of the manual was
contributed by Jacob Scott.
</P>
<P>

This walkthrough is for my level &quot;Advanced Tutorial&quot; in the
&quot;Tutorial&quot; level pack (to change level packs, click on &quot;Level Pack&quot;
at the bottom-left of the screen and select a level pack).  While you
are playing, you should read all the documents in a room as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>

The final goal for this level, as for most Enigma levels, is to find and
hit &quot;Oxyd&quot; stones with your black ball.  When you hit an oxyd stone, it
opens and shows a color.  If you hit two oxyd stones of the same color in
a row, they will both stay open.  Once you've matched up all pairs of
oxyd stones in a level, you have completed the level.
</P>
<P>

The level contains about twenty rooms, organized into three separate
areas.  In the first area, you will be encounter some of the basic
blocks and floor types you will see in Enigma levels and solve a couple
of simple puzzles.  The second area is more challenging and will
introduce you to a useful technique in outthinking an active enemy.  The
third and final area leads you to experiment with more advanced
interactions between Enigma objects.  In this particular level, all of
the oxyd stones can be found in a single room at the end of area 3.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="SEC31"></A>
<H3> 4.1.1 Area 1 </H3>
<!--docid::SEC31::-->
<P>

You start in a room surrounded by immovable walls except for a gap to
the right, some water near the bottom-left, and a closed gate near the
top-left.
</P>
<P>

Room 1: Go through the gap in the wall to the right.
</P>
<P>

Room 2: Simply avoid the blocks with pictures of skulls on them.
</P>
<P>

Room 3: Push the four wooden blocks into the water in the same row to
create a bridge to the opposite bank.  Now hit the blackish blocks to the
right.  Move the tan blocks out of the way (maybe to the left) and
bridge to the right with the two wooden blocks.
</P>
<P>

Room 4: Go close to the top.  When it begins to chase you, lead it to
the left and around the blocks in the center of the room.  Once the top
is far enough away from the entrance to the next room, run through.
</P>
<P>

Room 5: The only dangers here are the skulls near the bottom of the
room.  The first floor type is metal--this floor is similar to the
&quot;leaves&quot; floor that you have been traveling on so far.  The next floor
type is &quot;red&quot;---it is somewhat difficult to slow down or speed up on
this floor.  The third floor type is ice--there is little friction on
this floor.  The last floor type is space--there is no friction here;
you can't change velocity (speed and direction) when you are on this
type of floor.
</P>
<P>

Room 6: Simply go over the slopes.  Then exit to the left by passing over
the &quot;inverse&quot; floor--when you are on this type of floor and you push
the mouse (or similar controller) in one direction, the ball speeds up
in the opposite direction (if you are having trouble here, try turning
your mouse around 180 degrees).
</P>
<P>

Room 7: Try to get the extra ball by putting the movable block on the
lower trigger.  First hit it up one square and then left six
squares.  Next hit it five squares down and two squares to the right.
Finally hit it one square up and one square to the left. Take the extra
ball and then put the block on the other trigger to open the gate in the
left wall of the room.
</P>
<P>

Room 8: Take the dynamite (you will have to go on the ice) and drop it
in front of the yellow blocks to blow them up and get past.  The spade
is unnecessary but you should still experiment with it.
</P>
<P>

Room 9: Hit the lowest movable block to the left.  Now the boulders
trying to go to the right are blocking your path.  Hit the rightmost
movable block (to the left or to the right) to let the boulders
past.  Take the magic wand (don't accidentally hit any boulders when
the magic wand is in the front of your inventory) and hit the movable
block above the water down.  Now go back to the right of the room, put
the magic wand in the front of your inventory, and hit the top three
boulders of the long column (try not to get run over by any
boulders).  Hit the leftmost movable block to the left and go into the
next room.
</P>
<P>

Room 10: Hit the switch.  Now hit the two tan blocks up (one square
each).  Hit the middle (from top to bottom) wooden block to the left and
the wooden block that used to be right above it up into the water.  Hit
the rest of the blocks into the water in the same column (try not to
drown).  Now hit the window (the blue line) with high speed.  Take the
ball and cross over to the bridge into the first room.  From there go
through the open gate.
</P>
<P>

<H3> 4.1.2 Area 2 </H3>
<!--docid::SEC32::-->
<P>

In area two, you will encounter a rotor, which is an active enemy of
your black ball.  Different rotors can act slightly differently, but they
are never very smart.  The way to get past it is to trick it to do what
you want it to do, while keeping yourself out of danger.
</P>
<P>

Look around this area (but don't hit the movable block yet).  You need to
get through the three closed gates at the top of this area.
</P>
<P>

First gate: Hit the white ball to the left (don't accidentally go
through the black one-way block) to free it (this may require a few
tries).  Take the spoon and hit the white ball through the white one-way
block hard enough so that it doesn't get stuck.  Now go through the black
one-way block and hit the white ball through the passageway.  Hit the
white ball hard enough through the next white one-way block so it
doesn't get stuck beneath it.  Once the white ball is through, use the
spoon; you restart at the beginning of the level and are no longer
trapped.  Go back up through the gate--the first gate near the top of
this room is open.
</P>
<P>

Second gate: Hit the movable block in the rightmost room of this area to
the right and run.  A document with useful information should appear in
the gate connecting area one and area two.  Bring the rotor (by making it
chase you, like you did with the top) to above the wall to the right of
the gate between the first two areas.  Run through the gate and go over
the bridge to the room below you.  Hit the switch to close the gate and
return to the room where you initially started.  You will no longer be
able to see the rotor--it won't be in the room where you will be--but
if you look carefully, you will be able to see where it is.  The goal
here is to, without exposing yourself to any danger, get the rotor to go
to a trigger and open a gate for you.  Get the rotor to follow you from
the top-right of this room to the top-left of the room.  It should be
pushed to the left by some slopes.  Bring the rotor down on the left
until it will not continue and you hear the sound of a trigger being
pushed.  Hit the switch to open the gate and return to area two--the
second gate should be open.
</P>
<P>

Third gate: Simply hit the movable block that the rotor started under
to the trigger in the room where it started.  Return to the room to your
left--the third gate should be open.  Go through the three open
gates.
</P>
<P>

<H3> 4.1.3 Area 3 </H3>
<!--docid::SEC33::-->
<P>

In area three you need to explore the interactions between particular
Enigma objects.  Here you will find lasers, mirrors, and coins.  You will
need to solve a simple laser-and-mirror puzzle to get a laser to hit a
particular stone, which will open a bridge to the next room.  To get past
the next few rooms, you will need to create some new objects by hitting
existing objects with the laser beam.
</P>
<P>

In the first part of this area there are three mirrors and a laser with
a switch.
</P>
<P>

Room 1: You need to get the laser to hit the black stone.  Hit the
bottom-left mirror down one square and orient it so that it looks like a
&quot;\&quot; by hitting it slowly (it should be thirty squares directly to the
left of the laser).  Hit the top-left mirror eight squares to the left,
one square down, and orient it so that it looks like a &quot;/&quot; (it should
be four squares directly above the previous mirror).  Hit the top-right
mirror two squares up and then three squares to the right (it should be
twenty-two squares directly to the right of the previous mirror and one
square below the black stone).  Put this mirror in the &quot;/&quot;
orientation.  Now hit the switch to turn on the laser (don't get hit by
or roll over the laser beam).  Once it is completely up, go over the
bridge to your right.
</P>
<P>

Room 2: Take some coins and return to the previous room.  By turning off
and on the laser, hit one of the coins with the laser beam.  Take the
object produced (an umbrella), repeat the process, and take the second
umbrella.  Now drop one of the coins next to a mirror and hit the mirror
over it.  Hit this coin with a value of five with the laser beam to
produce a hammer.  Hit the hammer with the laser beam (by turning the
laser off and on) to produce a sword.  If you want some more balls, you
can hit mirrors over coins twice and hit the coins of increased value
(to ten, the highest possible) with the laser.  To return to the room
with the knights, put the mirrors back in their initial positions,
remove all objects blocking the laser, and hit the switch.  Now use the
right mouse button or the &quot;tab&quot; key to get the sword in the front
(left) of your inventory.  Hit some of the knights (four times each) to
get past.
</P>
<P>

Room 3: Use an umbrella and travel over the abyss to the room below you
and then into the room to your right.  If the ring surrounding you begins
to blink, use another umbrella.
</P>
<P>

Room 4: Simply match the oxyd stones by hitting oxyds of the same colors
as the activated oxyd stones (one at a time).  Don't hit the fart
stones (the black stones).  You win!

int: Intelligence and Creativity
  1 = I know where I am, I know where to go and how
      to get there; without even moving the marble!
  2 = Okay, give me a minute to orient myself...
  3 = There's some standard algorithm to solve this...
      (like e.g. mazes or slight variations of them)
  4 = Trial-and-error won't work and there is no
      algorithm to solve it quickly... some kind of
      code or advanced planning or so... 
  5 = ...some difficult kind of code...

dex: Dexterity
  1 = It doesn't matter what I touch;
      this level is damn-proof.
  2 = Okay, there are some lethal positions I
      shouldn't move the level into.
  3 = The standard one-row-to-death-way
  4 = Pushing without falling?
  5 = Pushing without falling ten times in a row?

pat: Patience
  (Everything meant as "feeled time", the real time 
   can be estimated from the par_times)
  1 = I solved it right after understanding the level.
  2 = I needed some time but it wasn't boring.
  3 = Okay, some minutes. But the landscape is nice...
  4 = I know what to do but it doesn't seem to end...
  5 = This really needs discipline.

kno: Knowledge of the game
  1 = Must...open...oxyd...stones...
      Everything else is explained. (e.g. Tutorials)
  2 = Simple mechanics, like pushing and
      bridge-building, connected puzzle-stones,
      simple shogun-stones, no item-transformations
  3 = Playing the Advanced Tutorial is enough
  4 = Standard-objects that are not shown in the tutorial,
      like rubber-bands, unconnected puzzle-stones,
      springs, thiefs, three-parted shogun-stones,
      invisible and hole-stones, wormholes, magnets,
      restart...
  5 = Needs deeper understanding of the game,
      like: cracks are items, too; seeds can grow inside
      grates and one-way streets...
  6 = This level uses a (more or less) unique mechanism
      or seldom used object. (However, this mechanism or
      object may or may not be easy to understand, e.g.
      "Flood Control" vs. "Everhungry"; this goes into
      the int/pat-rating.)

spe: Speed and speed-control
  1 = No time limit.
  2 = Don't stop for too long.
      (e.g. something slow is chasing me or swamp)
  3 = There is a proper time limit of some kind.
  4 = Don't stop.
      (e.g. something fast is chasing me)
  5 = Hurry up!

&ldquo;These games are so good that I cannot understand why they are not
sold commercially. Anyhow, I am pleased they  exist. I will watch your progress
on your homepage. It must be a huge challenge to create such perfect games.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Thanks for writing such a fun and exciting game.  I just love puzzle games,
and this is one of the best I've seen.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;I've played a little bit Oxyd more than 10 years ago, but didn't get
addicted to it. That's impossible when using Enigma.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;It's the first puzzle game I really enjoyed - a great game! Really nice
2D graphics, a lot of variety, cute and well-designed levels &hellip; I liked the
fact that sometimes it is VERY challenging - I've spent more than an hour to
beat some levels!&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;This is a fun, original and challenging puzzle game that stretches your
mind and has many, many levels. The game is also polished, professional, and
non-violent.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;I was amazed at what a great game this is. The basic puzzles excellent,
and ordered very well by difficulty. But also the game is very polished, nice
graphics and music, very simple user interface. What an outstanding example of
a polished free software game? Every Linux distribution should include
Enigma!!!!&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;But what can I say? I have been playing the puzzle in every spare second
ever since, and I'm still not tired of it, though some levels make me want to
toss my mouse out of the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Enigma is the best game ever! [&hellip;] My hand hurts from playing this so much.
I can't wait to hit all the new levels!!!&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Oxyd again, Yay! Why did it take me so long to notice Enigma, after years of
dead-Atari-Oxyd-deprivation? Thanks to everyone involved in bringing this
wonderful game back to life and more!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, thank you for keeping this wonderful code base
(Oxyd -&gt; Enigma) alive and well!  I loved the original games (even back in
the NeXTStep days!) but could never share my love of the game with other
gamers because so few people ever knew the game existed.  Now I'm spreading
the word and hoping to get a new generation of fans to love this game as I
do.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Personally I prefer the (typically easier) meditation levels, but
there's plenty of variation and multiple skill levels so you're likely to
discover a game style that suits your tastes - so long as you spend the time
to explore all the options. Enigma might not be the prettiest thing around but
it's a great freebie with an enormous number of classic remakes and
original levels to choose from.&rdquo;</p>

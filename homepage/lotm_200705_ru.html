    &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; by Dominik Lehmann
  </h3>

  <p>&quot;Welcome to Chile! Eight hours ago, your plane arrived at the
  Airport of &#39;Llamas&#39;, which is a small village surrounded by
  unexplored jungle terrain. Now you find yourself in front of an impressive
  temple, which seems to be a relic of the ancient Aztec ages. But the temple
  is in a surprising good condition &hellip;&quot; Welcome to the Level of
  the Month! And enter &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot;!</p>

  <p>3 votes, resulting in an overwhelming 9.33 in April. There is not a
  single level that polarizes Enigma's community the way &quot;The Aztec
  Temple&quot; does. A dedicated storyline, wonderful puzzles, interwoven to a
  great unity versus intangible difficulty and infinite frustration. Just
  count the forum entries on mag-heut.net <a 
  href="http://www.mag-heut.net/blackball/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=8&amp;t=574&amp;st=0"
  >here</a>;
  it's the only two-page-thread in the hints sections!</p>

  <h4>&quot;I still felt a compulsion to come back and explore some
  more&quot;</h4>

  <p class="quote">There are many levels of Enigma that you can look at and
  immediately  know exactly what it is you have to do to solve them.  These
  aren't  my favorite levels of the game.  I prefer the levels that require
  exploration and discovery - that unfold before you through trial and error
  - that offer a solution to you that you have to strive to  earn.
  &quot;Aztec Temple&quot; is one of these.  It is a challenging level.  You
  have to execute certain maneuvers exactly right, or you're back to square
  one.</p>

  <p class="quote">There is a very crucial moment (for me at least) where you
  have to hit a wood stone just right to avoid recoiling against an impulse
  stone and ruining all your hard work up until that point.  Retrieving the
  key from the swamp requires some serious focus and agility.  And there are
  rotors to dodge.</p>

  <p class="quote">In Dominik Lehmann's amusing story, those rotors are guard
  dogs protecting the temple.  While not all the facts are historically
  accurate (the Aztecs never got anywhere near Chile or South America for that
  matter), his tale is a delightful component in this level.  It tells of a
  scrappy little black marble who takes on a greedy,  unscrupulous villain
  (who looks a lot like a deadly, rotating top),  defeats him, and gains
  access to the inner sanctum of the temple and all its treasure.  I know that
  I want to be just like that true-hearted, valiant marble in my own personal
  life!</p>

  <p class="quote">In playing &quot;Aztec Temple&quot;, I found myself
  defeated again and again, but I still felt a compulsion to come back and
  explore some more while I tried out potential solutions to the many
  challenging puzzles.  I gained access to the inner sanctum a few times
  before I made all the right moves to enable me to reach the endorphin rush
  that a solution to a level like this brings with it.</p>

  <p class="quote">&quot;Aztec Temple&quot; is not for the faint of heart, but
  it's a terrific journey to take with a very satisfying solution.  Have a
  nice journey, and stay calm!</p>
  <p class="author">Taztunes</p>

  <p>That's totally right: The story Dominik tells us through his level
  somehow makes this level different. He binds us to it, by curiousity of
  course, but also by means of identification. Most games draw their tension
  from the identification of the player with some character of a story, and
  then unfold the story to keep the gamer playing. It's another kind of
  entertainment, that's sometimes missing in Enigma's rational
  world. &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; closes this gap.</p>

  <h4>&quot;There's still one small mystery&quot;</h4>

  <p>Tarim found another delightful aspect of this level:</p>

  <div class="lotmpic">
    <img src="images/lotm/lotm_200705_b.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
    <div class="imagetitle">Rescuing Xila</div>
  </div>

  <p class="quote">Aztec Temple is more than just about rolling a marble
  around; it's a complete alternate reality with some great reversals.  The
  Aztecs are in Chile; their treasure is diamonds and you are a black hero
  rescuing a white native girl. There are some lovely puzzles which are
  entangled with each other like the overgrown jungle they're set in.
  Although the game play can be somewhat unforgiving (one slip and it's
  shifteffthree time) this just adds to the overall atmosphere.  You can spend
  a long time thinking about what to do next, but if you get it wrong then
  you've had it; the evil Gerald Gregory Goshers will win and you will never
  receive any thanks from the delightfully rounded Xila &hellip;</p>

  <p class="quote">Having finished it - there's still one small mystery - what
  to do with the stone you've carefully extracted from the side entrance of
  the temple? Let's hope it's a clue for Aztec Temple, part 2 (come on
  Dominik, you know you want to write it).</p>
  <p class="author">Tarim</p>

  <p>At least I hope so!</p>

  <h4>&quot;&#39;Aztec Temple&#39; outclasses
  everything we know in this respect&quot;</h4>

  <p>I already pointed at the trench &quot;Aztec Temple&quot; drew through the
  community. Reflecting this outside world, the trench spread into the
  developers' circle as well &hellip;</p>

  <p class="quote">Aztec Temple surely is the first (and last?) level that
  talks to the gamer for a long time and tells them a story. The first that
  doesn't use the documents only to give hints to the player. But it starts a
  real dialogue and thereby draws the gamer into its mystical world. I think,
  it is the level with the most &quot;it-documents&quot :-)</p>

  <p class="quote">The level belongs to a seldom and very suspenseful category
  of levels, which I want to call &quot;journey levels&quot; or maybe better
  &quot;levels with story&quot;.</p>

  <p class="quote">It's a level that takes you on a thrilling expedition with
  lots of smaller and bigger puzzles at the roadside. Of course there are
  levels that give a similar sensation with their linear layout, like the
  &quot;Gods of Enigma&quot;. However, &quot;Aztec Temple&quot; outclasses
  everything we know in this respect.</p>

  <p class="quote">Only too obvious why the level remained unsolved for many
  weeks after the release of Enigma 1.00. And we asked ourselves, is it really
  too difficult? Fortunately, &quot;Moneymaker&quot; put us out of this
  misery. However, till today, only very few players were able to solve
  &quot;Aztec Temple&quot;. I failed, too.</p>

  <p class="quote">Such a hard level earns a special place, doesn't it? Until
  recently, it was part of the &quot;mythology&quot; decade in level pack
  VI. However, with the release of Enigma 1.01 it will meritedly be the master
  level of pack VI, level number 100.</p>
  <p class="author">Raoul Bourquin</p>

  <p>Indeed, &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; will move from position 39 to
  100. There it will still define a counterpoint to the Roman/Greek mythology
  decade and, in a somewhat deeper sense, to the second decade as well. The
  hole it leaves in the mythology decade will be filled by a very old level
  which only shortly appeared in Enigma 0.70, then suddenly disappeared and
  after its own odyssey found its way back home; but that's another story!
  ;-)</p>

  <h4>&quot;I didn't plan the level to be this difficult&quot;</h4>

  <p>Although he's heavily busy with school at the moment, Dominik found some
  time to write us his thoughts on Enigma, level writing and our well known
  temple:</p>

  <p class="quote">I think, Enigma crossed my way the first time in version
  0.70. This was about 4 years ago. Until then, I never saw a game similar to
  Enigma (like Oxyd). For myself, games are only interesting when I can tinker
  with them in a creative way, mostly by designing levels. Directly after I
  started to play Enigma, I wanted to build own levels, too. And due to the
  lattice-like environment of the game, a level editor seemed quite
  reasonable.</p>

  <p class="quote"> Unfortunately, no editor was integrated in the game, so I
  took a look at the level files. Awaiting a binary file, I was quite amazed
  to see a scripting language as an elementary component of the level in my hex
  editor. I then read Enigma's documentation, which was still rather short in
  those days. I still found Lua to be too cumbersome and a graphical editor
  environment not only possible, but indicated. Hence, I searched on
  mag-heut.net and found the BlackBallED. With this editor I started to build
  &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot;. After I designed the first room, the controls 
  of this otherwise good editors annoyed me so much that I decided to write
  one myself.</p>

  <p class="quote">It took quite a long time (3 months or so) until I finished
  my own editor in VB. This way I could setup the user interface the way I
  wanted to. With this editor I then finished &quot;The Aztec
  Temple&quot;.</p>

  <p class="quote">Actually, I didn't plan the level to be this
  difficult. But I had so many ideas for puzzles in my head, and I wanted to
  use all of them, without realizing that already their total count would
  make the level more and more difficult and frustrating. I developed the
  single components of the level in the sequence in which they're to be solved
  today.</p>

  <p class="quote">When I finished writing the level I said to myself
  &quot;Okay, just one time gambling through it, then it's finished&quot;. As
  I noticed that it's really fierce to solve one of the partly lethal puzzles
  after the other, it was too late to ease it anymore; just because all the
  elements are interdependent. I think I needed just as long for solving the
  level as I did for writing it. Then I got the affirmation that it's
  difficult, but solvable, I just left it the way it was. And set out to not
  overcharge my next creations that much.</p>

  <p class="quote">The story the level tells, doesn't really have a
  background. As I constructed the first room, I thought that I had to explain
  to the gamer what he sees (as it isn't obvious from graphics that there is
  some jungle and a temple). Thus I tried to explain with each puzzle, what
  the elements mean. As I met the purely technically inspired need of adding a
  second actor, the further course of the randomly started storyline was just
  a logical consequence. The room in which the white marble started became
  the &quot;Wild's Cage&quot; all by itself. And a simple
  &quot;it-document&quot; at the corresponding trigger made the story
  consistent.</p>

  <p class="quote">Well, as I said. The level is indeed disproportionately
  hard; however, I have no idea how to change this without affecting the
  overall structure of it. The flags (being another point of criticism on
  mag-heut.net) were meant to simulate a kind of save-game function. The
  shortcuts that result from them are nevertheless undesirable.</p>
  <p class="author">Dominik Lehmann</p>

  <p>Dominik added a way to resolve this problem, and some thoughts about an
  easier easy-mode. We'll discuss this and will hopefully come back with a
  solution - though not yet with 1.01. We shouldn't rush through providing a
  better easy-mode, just as the level itself shouldn't be rushed through while
  gaming. It's a wonderful creation, not neccesarily made for solving, but by
  all means made for enjoyment! Thank you very much for this jewel of a level,
  Dominik!</p>

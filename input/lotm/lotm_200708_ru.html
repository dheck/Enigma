    &quot;Houdini&quot; by Ronald Lamprecht
  </h3>

  <p>Grab your top hat, search your magic wand, this month it's going to be
  magic! Ronald named his level after the great escapologist Harry Houdini, and
  this is exactly how you start: Bound to a rubber stone, guarded by thieves,
  trapped by abyss beside you, the oxyds far away behind water and locks, whose
  keys are fused in glass &hellip; can you still open your locks and oxyds? For this
  level you need all your skills; logic, precision, and dexterity!</p>

  </div>

  <p>&quot;Houdini&quot; got an average rating of <b>8.67</b> from 9 gamers (5
  of them voting for an older version) which makes it third in the current
  <a href="$$lotm$$">LotM-highscore</a>. Sorry, we can't give a
  highscore-list this month, as a recent release-change makes the
  scores incomparable to each other :-/. As a compensation, you can now sort
  our LotM-highscore by rating, month, and position!

  <h4>&quot;Many happy hours of puzzling&quot;</h4>

  <div class="quote">
  Many puzzle levels force the player down a path to find that one twist which
  will unlock those elusive oxyds.  Not so Houdini.  Houdini gives a far more open
  space with a myriad of interactions between chess stones, swap stones, pull
  stone and brake.  Though this leads to many possible routes - it's not easy to
  find one that works &hellip; Tarim was always surprised when he made a mistake, to
  find that if he thought about it for a while, there might still be another way
  to complete the level.  Of course, it wasn't always so - how Tarim remembers
  setting up nearly everything for the solution only to slip into the abyss and
  find that he had left the pull stone over the respawn space.  There he was,
  trapped like a fly in amber, with nothing to do but F3 all those extra lives
  away :(  Or the time he accidently posted his yin-yang away - he spent some time
  with the swap stones trying to get it back - only to discover (well you can find
  out for yourselves &hellip;)  Ah, this one certainly gave Tarim many happy hours of
  puzzling :)

  <div class="author">Tarim</div>

  <p>Ronald is a strong advocate of levels in which nothing is hidden -
  &quot;Houdini&quot; shows this quite impressively. Although not all things are
  visible at first, it's not too difficult to find the missing links and things.
  Tying them together to a working solution is the challenge!
  Harry Houdini was a strong anti-spiritualist. He hid his tricks from his
  audience, surely, but he always assured that everything happens according to
  nature's laws. His friendship with Arthur Conan Doyle was heavily encumbered
  when Doyle started to believe that Houdini escaped using esoteric powers and
  didn't believe Houdini's explanations. Houdini then decided to expose the
  psychics and mediums who swam on the bow wave of the rising Spiritualism
  movement at the turn of the century. He became part of a committee of
  &quot;Scientific American&quot; and debunked numerous cases. And just as
  Houdini's magic had nothing extramundane in it, Ronald uses just the
  mechanics natural to Enigma: No timer stones, no internal queries for
  stones or positions, no chameleons, no hollow stones, no trigger codes - just
  plain Enigma. Well, with one exception &hellip;</p>
  
  <div class="quote">
  My first thought, when I started playing Houdini, was
  that it's not only difficult but extraneous and
  different. Usually in a standard level you have hard
  and easy moments. In Houdini you cannot rest, it's one
  challenge after the other. Every mystery must be
  solved and executed with precision. Ronald did an
  impressive job here. 
  You have to master riding a horse. In fact I learned
  the movements and behavior of the chess stone playing
  this level. 
  Don't you hate thieves? Of course you do. Well in
  Houdini you can take revenge on them and become a
  thief hunter. For the first time you can recover
  what they plundered from you. But be careful, they are dangerous in some
  instances, one mistake and game over. There are steps
  to accomplish before you get success.
  If you like thinking logically and you're not afraid
  of hard work, try Houdini. You'll enjoy it very much.
  I think this level is the &quot;extremely-hard&quot; kind; the
  best of course within the
  &quot;logic-intelligence-strategy&quot; group of levels. For
  consistent players only.</div>

  <p>If you don't understand what Ale just hinted at, try &quot;Knight's
  Journey&quot;. Although it might seem as if this feature was created just to
  suit &quot;Houdini&quot;, it isn't so. However, another feature was added to
  Enigma specifically for this level - the exception I mentioned above -
  and it hasn't been used since. Hence, I want to advertise a bit for it;
  this'll become a bit technical, and is directed towards level authors. See the
  scissor stone on the right? Scissor stones since 1.00 call their
  action/target-pair when they cut a rubberband. This simple addition gives lots
  of possibilites at hand: You can ensure that the gamer removes a rubberband
  before entering some region of the level, or force them to free a rotor,  
  or trigger some more complicated action. Now imagine a net of small white
  marbles connected by rubberbands, and one or more scissor stones. Open doors
  by removing the rubberbands, but remember that the marbles change their
  positions after this &hellip;</p>

  <h4>&quot;I've lost more marbles to the HOUDINIan abyss than to the Trojan
  waters&quot;</h4>

  <p>As loyal readers will know, I did not have the honor to contribute a Level
  of the Month of my own yet. However, with &quot;Houdini&quot; at least a small
  little piece was added by me: I was the one to suggest the wood floor, yes! At
  first this was only a consideration on colors and designs, as wood fits with
  the many other elements. But retrospectively I think it adds some more charm
  to this level, as it somehow resembles the stage of a magician like Harry
  Houdini &hellip; Now, let's listen to what Harry can tell us about this level:</p>

  <div class="quote">
  Today is the 31st day of July, birthday of fiction's best known wizard of all
  times, Harry Potter. A good day to write an article about another wizard and
  another Harry, the Great HOUDINI, the most famous magician, illusionist and
  escapist of the early 20th century or - as many would say so - of all time.
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
  Or more precisely i'll try to elaborate my impressions of a level created by
  one of Enigma's magicians, Mr Ronald Lamprecht, and which obviously was
  inspired by HOUDINI's escaping arts and in his honor bears his name: HOUDINI.
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
  Compared to the size of Enigma's first Level of the Month &quot;Island
  Labyrinth&quot;, with its two screens HOUDINI is not much bigger than a milk
  can compared to dairy. To escape from such a giant milk can filled with water
  and then padlocked was one of HOUDINI's most spectacular tricks. </div>

    <div class="imagetitle"><p>Aviation was also one of Houdini's hobbys,
    </p><p>but without restraints!</p></div>
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
  By no means from its small size one should jump to conclusions that it's easy
  to disentangle HOUDINI's knots. Completely to the contrary it's the most
  challenging level i was able to manage so far. Especially with the last
  revision, HOUDINI's &quot;Difficult Mode&quot; now does deserve this mark, one
  really has to be a master of escapology to succeed. And there's no &quot;short
  cut&quot; available as (according to legends) for the Great Alexander with the
  Gordian knot. I strongly recommend to everyone to try &quot;Easy Mode&quot;
  first.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  You start the game tied to a stone with a rubber band. Your first task is
  to free yourself from this shackle and to open the door to the second room.
  It's not so easy walking around leashed like a dog. And how you will strain at
  the leash at times: in vain.</div>

  <div class="quote">You need quite a bit of careful consideration to figure out
  how to manage this task. Carrying out your plans requires that you gather
  together all the dexterity you've got and then concentrate. And
  you need a lot of patience as you'll have to repeat certain actions
  again and again.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  In particular, jumping across the abyss while tied with this rubber band
  without coming into contact with those highwaymen really is an art. This sort
  of bungee-jumping often comes to a bad end. I've lost more marbles to the
  HOUDINIan abyss than to the Trojan waters. If one of you ever learns to love
  such sport please let me know.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  Though this part of the game is the most difficult one, at a rough guess it
  just takes up one fifth of the time you need to finish HOUDINI. So there's
  still work to be done &hellip;</div>

  <div class="quote">
  I've spent more time with HOUDINI than with any other level so far. But what
  kept me going on when reaching a deadlock? A natural ambition to
  finish things started alone would not have been enough. Two things helped:
  There is some kind of magic to the name of the level that invoked
  extraordinary perseverance inside me. As i've seen in my crystal ball things
  could have taken an entirely different course: If Ronald would have decided to
  call it &quot;Chess-Stone-Demo IV&quot; instead, i'm sure i would have
  surrendered. And there is this note you find once you've opened the first
  door. It reminded me of one of the favorite books of my youth: &quot;The
  Neverending Story&quot;. Suddenly it was no more just a level that had to be
  solved: a world had to be rescued.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  Some concluding words: &quot;Houdini&quot; is difficult, it's really hard to
  succeed, but it's playable, it's enjoyable, it's full of surprises, and it's
  very well devised! Brilliant work, Ronald!</div>
  <div class="author">Daydreamer-Harry</div>

  <p>Harry already mentioned &quot;Troy&quot; - this level offers you some
  riding lessons for free before you try your stunts in &quot;Houdini&quot;.
  &quot;Random space&quot; might be of help as well, to get some feeling for the
  rubber bands.</p>

  <h4>&quot;The freestyle design of Houdini is a key to its
  versatility&quot;</h4>

  <p>Here's what the author himself can tell us about his level's history:</p>

  <div class="quote">
  In August 2006 &quot;st-chess&quot; emerged from a joined brainstorming 
  targeting the addition of a most favourable new object. Andreas
  did initiate the discussion with some prototypes and Raoul did favour a stone
  moving 2 grids straight forward being able to jump over another stone. But
  when I proposed to use instead the chess knights move,
  that could be controlled by the marble's hit direction, we all agreed
  immediatly. Andreas did a great job in coding the stone and added
  the black and white flavours. &quot;Checkmate I&quot;, &quot;The Stable&quot;
  and  &quot;Chessing Positions&quot; were the first levels using the new
  object. Now it was my turn to write a demo level that makes use of all
  &quot;st-chess&quot; features especially as I had asked for it being the natural
  enemy of the thief stone.</div>

  <div class="lotmpic">
    <img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200708_b.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
    <div class="imagetitle">Captured! But was this a good idea?</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="quote">
  Thus I had a closer look on patterns of &quot;st-chess&quot; in combination
  with other stones. I made experiments how to move &quot;st-chess&quot; in
  narrow alleys and what it needs to stop an &quot;st-chess&quot; crossing a
  barrier. In just a few hours I collected so many interesting patterns that I
  was convinced that I could write a valuable level.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  Next evening I started with the design of &quot;Houdini&quot;. Due to the
  tedious way of moving a &quot;st-chess&quot; I limited the size of the level
  to 2 rooms. As the patterns were complex enough I decided to create a WYSIWYG
  level. Both rooms should be visible and all essential objects should be
  visible or locatable within the first few moves. Finding a way to reach the
  obvious targets with the given objects should be the main challenge of the
  level.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  In contrast to &quot;st-wood&quot; that is usually a one-way object as it
  sinks in water or ends up unmovable at a wall the &quot;st-chess&quot; can
  fulfill purposes and can easily be reused for further tasks. Thus I designed
  the whole level to make heavy use of reusability - not limited to the
  &quot;st-chess&quot; but of all components. It proved to be a challenge of
  it's own.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  Another technique, that I used first on &quot;Houdini&quot; and that I call
  nowadays &quot;freestyle&quot;, is the freedom for the player to use every
  item and movable stone anywhere he likes. Of course you first have to free
  them - remember the level is named &quot;Houdini&quot;. This freedom is
  another challenge as it is no longer obvious which objects to use for a
  certain task. Another consequence of this freedom are different solution
  patterns at some points of the levels. But the various intended solution
  patterns are all equivalent and differ just in very local aspects. All other
  emerging solution approaches are ridiculously complex. The
  &quot;freestyle&quot; design of &quot;Houdini&quot; is a key to its
  versatility. </div>

  <div class="quote">
  I admit that &quot;Houdini&quot; is a very difficult level that needs to be
  solved by a lot of thinking - take your time. I am happy to see that several
  users did deduce the solution without any hints. Actually I designed essential
  parts by trying to solve candidate patterns on my own. Writing
  &quot;Houdini&quot; did take me just 2 evenings and an afternoon. I started on
  Wednesday and mailed the first version on Friday evening. Afterwards I just
  had to fix a few minor shortcuts and to solve the level on my own noticing
  what a challenge this level is.</div>
  
  <div class="quote">
  Good luck solving, and have fun!</div>
  
  <div class="author">Ronald Lamprecht</div>

  <p>&quot;Houdini&quot; undoubtedly is one of the most sophisticated levels of
  today's Enigma, and it needs no sorcery to say that it will persist being one
  of the best levels in Enigma for many years to come, combining a unique
  atmosphere and gameplay with traditional elements of the game. Ronald, thank
  you very much for this masterwork of level wizardry!</p>

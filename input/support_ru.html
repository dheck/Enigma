<h2>User Support</h2>

<p>Got Enigma and looking for more information? For upcoming questions we
wrote manuals and collected FAQ's. The documentation should reveal a lot of
features that you may look for. If you are stuck on a level or just want to
discuss Enigma with others you should have a look at the forum. You can actively
participate to Enigma as a user by submitting your scores and ratings of levels.
Your results will be part of the statistics evaluation and will be your vote
for the level of the month.</p>

<h3><a class="arrowup" href="$$support$$"><img src="$$imagedir$$/nav_up.gif" alt="Up" border="0" title="back to top"></a>
  <a name="forum">User Forum</a></h3>

  <p>Playing a game like Enigma causes a demand for communication. You may want
  to discuss your solution of a level with others or you may search for some tiny
  hints for others. On the forum <a href="http://www.mag-heut.net">mag-heut.net</a>
  you can share your experience with hundreds of other users.</p>

  <p>Just a request on behalf of all forum users: please search for discussion
  threads that have been started to the same topic, e.g. level. Append your
  remark or question via 'reply' instead of starting a new thread.</p>

  <p>And another request on behalf of the level authors: do not spoil levels by publishing
  walkthrough solutions. Even other users will usually prefer decent hints. The
  forum offers the possibility to write hints with the same color as the background
  (color &quot;spoiler&quot;). Users will see the hints without being directly
  able to read them. By selecting the text you can read the hints you have
  need of. Keep the fascination alive for all users.</p>

  <a name="score">Score and Rating Registration</a></h3>

  <p>Starting with Enigma 1.00 you can register your scores and ratings. Why is
  it useful to submit your results? Based on as many user results as possible
  we calculate statistics that you use when you inspect a level's info. Thus even
  the fact that many users did not solve certain levels is as important as the
  knowledge of top scores for improving Enigma.</p>

  <p>Please take the time to rate levels. Right or ctrl click on
  the level icon in the level menu to view the level inspector. At the bottom
  line you can rate a level with values from 0 (bad) to 10 (top). Try to judge
  bad levels as well as good levels. Average levels should be judged by a value
  of 5. Your judgement shows which levels users like and is the basis for the
  'Level of the Month' selection.</p>

  <p>You need to choose a unique user name in the options menu. Please look at
  the <a href="$$statistics$$#userlist">users&nbsp;list</a> if your favorite name
  is not in use by someone else.</p>

  <p>For registration of your scores, just send us your 'enigma.score'
  file. It is located at your 'user path' that Enigma shows you on
  pressing F2 at the main menu. Please send just this one file to
  <a href="mailto:score@enigma-game.org">score@enigma-game.org</a>
  with subject 'score - username' (substitute 'username' by
  the name you have chosen!).</p>

  <p> The scores are evaluated on a monthly base. Please do not send your score file
  after every good score that you achieved. Once at the end of the month is
  sufficient.</p>

  <p>The updated statistics will be downloaded to your computer if you set the
  ratings update option to 'Auto'. Enigma will peek the server only a few times
  per month, independent how often you start the application. The network traffic
  is very low as just increments are downloaded and you will receive all updates
  within a few days.</p>

  <p>If you play most times offline and set the update option to 'Never'
  you may manually download the ratings update file
  <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/ratings/ratings.xml.zip">ratings.xml</a>.
  Extract the file from the zip and copy it to your 'user path' aside
  your 'enigma.score' file.</p>

  <a name="bug">Bug Reporting</a></h3>

  <p>We appreciate any report about problems with Enigma. Of course a software
  with more than 200&nbsp;000 lines of code and complex gaming logic like Enigma is
  never bug free. But Enigma reached a quite stable 1.00 release with many
  thousands of users. Please first look at the documentation, FAQ and user
  forum for possible similar reports.</p>

  <p>For problems besides the solvability of levels send a mail to the developers
  mailing list <a href="mailto:enigma-devel@nongnu.org" >enigma-devel@nongnu.org</a>
  (you do not need to subscribe to the list).
  Please include the following basic information:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What operating system are you using?</li>
    <li>Which Enigma version are you using?</li>
    <li>What did you do when the bug happened?</li>
    <li>What exactly did you see then?</li>
    <li>Is the problem ongoing or reproduceable?</li>
    </ul>
  <p>If you file a report please stay tuned on and answer further requests on
  specific details by our developers. Do not expect immediate answers - it may
  take some time for the right people to answer your request.</p>

  <p>Problems with single levels should be reported to the user forum
  <a href="http://www.mag-heut.net">mag-heut.net</a>. Please keep in mind that
  all levels have been proven solvable with Enigma 1.00. But unintended shortcuts
  or annoyances with levels will remain an ongoing topic and may sometimes emerge
  to be caused by inconsistencies within Enigma itself.</p>

  <p>Developers may want to file bug reports directly to our bug database at
  <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/enigma-game/">Berlios.</a>

  <a name="donation">Donation</a></h3>

  <p>We are just wondering if users would be willing to support the further
  development of Enigma financially. Just donating a fraction of the amount
  you would be willing to spend for a commercial 'Enigma' in a store
  would help us to improve Enigma. If you think this would be a fair deal, send
  us mail to <a href="mailto:donation@enigma-game.org" >donation@enigma-game.org</a>
  and we will set up a donation account dedicated to Enigma.</p>

    /** 
     * A switch that points to one of the four directions turning on every
     * switching event. It is a StateObject with 4 states that directly
     * represent the pointing direction. "toggle", "signal", and get/set of
     * the state are fully supported. The FourSwitch starts per default in
     * NORTH. The turning direction is clockwise per default and can be set
     * by the bool attribute "counterclock".<p>
     * Due to history and as very useful feature this object has two modes
     * of actions, a state dependent and a "global" state independent mode:
     * <p>
     * In the state dependent mode the state dependent target (target_0,...)
     * of the old state will receive an action value of "false" prior to
     * the turn. The new state will receive an action value of "true" after
     * the turn. This suits any connect signal receiver.<p>
     * But in the global mode just one action is send to the global "target"
     * with the direction representing value of the new state. This value
     * suits messages to objects like OneWayStone and BoulderStone. But it
     * works with signal messages to any StateObject as well, switching them
     * on and off in turn. To change the meaning of on and off you can set
     * the "inverse" attribute to "true".<p>
     * The Fourswitch is turned just on signal values of "1". Use "toggle"
     * messages to switch indepent of values.<p>
     * The state can be set anytime to any direction. Actions are performed
     * accordingly.<p>
     * Please note that due to compatibility just bool values are send to
     * global targets in the old API.
